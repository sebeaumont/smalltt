# The cabal projects file is local to avoid stack builds

TODO: might need to update  commit version w.r.t current stack.

NOTA: This appears not to be the case currently but the source repos themselves
have updates -- which confuses git-summary and me. Is git not aware of this?
How does cabal check out the project dependencies? Hmm.
